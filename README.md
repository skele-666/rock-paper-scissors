# rock-paper-scissors

The project was to create a rock paper scissors game in JavaScript that plays 5 rounds and keeps score. This was much harder for me than any of the other TOP projects I've completed (that were only HTML and CSS), as I am rather new to JavaScript. It involved a lot of debugging, problem-solving and quite a few brain breaks, but it was fun nonetheless. :)
